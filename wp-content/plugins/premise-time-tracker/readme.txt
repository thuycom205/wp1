Track time spent on projects. This plugin comes with a Chrome Extension to easily create timers while you are working!

== Description ==

This plugin creates a 'Timers' custom post type on your site that you can use to record your time spent in projects. When you add your time you can assign a client or project to keep track of things appropriately. We are introducing "Timesheets" soon where you will be able to create a timesheet from selected timers and bill from it.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the plugin main folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Start adding Timers :)
