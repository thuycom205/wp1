    <question>
        <q>
            Compare NAT instance and NAT gateway in these perspective :
            1. bandwidth 2. maintenance, performance 4. public IP 5. Security group 6. Bastion host
        </q>
        <a>
            Nat instance has limit bandwidth
            you have to maintain NAT instance on your own

            you can detach public IP address from NAT instance but you can not detach public IP address from NAT gateway

            you can attach security group to NAT instance but can not attach to NAT gateway

            NAT instance can be bastion host , in contrast you can not do it with NAT gateway
